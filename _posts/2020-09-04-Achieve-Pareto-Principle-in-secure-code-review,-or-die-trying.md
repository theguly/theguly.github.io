# Achieve Pareto Principle in secure code review, or die trying @ EndSummerCamp2020

No doubt that 2020 has been a weird year. I don't want to talk or to comment what happened to health structures, jobs , companies, and the whole economy, nor I want to "predict" what will happen in the next months.

What I want to do is to point out what also happened to conferences: almost every con has been delayed from spring/summer to fall, then winter, then dropped or moved to a virtual one.

[EndSummerCamp](https://www.endsummercamp.org/) choosed to resist and to have a "blended edition": a limited number of people, done with due to anti-covid regulations, attended physically when a broader public attended to the virtual event.

As a "veteran" (I already had 3 talk for ESC) I thought I must accept the challenge and do play my part filling a slot.

The talk I prepared, respecting the 22minutes time limit, was a rush on secure code review.  
I tried to get the people in the mood when doing code audit, because it could/will be very stressfull, and passed some lesson learned from my very own experience.

You can find the slides online [here]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/2020/rushing_secure_code_review-public.pdf). I'm not sure they can talk themself enough, you can just take the mindmap and get over the rest if you prefer.

I think I'll try to set up a regular talk, or maybe a full workshop, for EndSummerCamp2021 and hoply I'll have something more to talk about next year.

There was be no beer with friends, no late night hacking sessions, no camping, and I think I also missed early morning wake up with Enter the Ninja.

ESC was a thing even in 2020, and I'm proud to have played my part.
